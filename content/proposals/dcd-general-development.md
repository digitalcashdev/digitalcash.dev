I'm submitting two proposals:

1. [DCD JS SDK platform support](https://digitalcash.dev/proposals/dcd-general-development/) -
   200 DASH/month for 3 months
2. **DCD general development** (this one)- 200 DASH/month for 3 months

I have [several ideas](https://digitalcash.dev/proposals/) for how I can
add value in Dash, but I want to work on whatever the network wants me to
prioritize.

I am confident I can make good progress on adding Platform support to our
[Dash SDK](https://github.com/dashhive/).

If the network would like me to work on this please vote for
[DCD JS SDK platform support](https://digitalcash.dev/proposals/dcd-platform-js-sdk/).

If the network would like to defer to my judgement please vote on **DCD general
development** (this one).

I am happy to have **both pass**, in which case I can allocate close to full
time and/or build a reserve which I can draw on when the network needs my
support with anything.
